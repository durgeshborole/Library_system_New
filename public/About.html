      <h2>ðŸ“– About the Software</h2>
      <p>
        The <strong>MITCORER Library Visitor Management System</strong> is a smart, barcode-based application developed to track and manage student and faculty visits to the college library. It automates the entry and exit process by scanning barcodes, logging each visit in real-time, and displaying visitor details instantly.
      </p>
      <p>
        The system supports automatic detection of a visitor's <strong>department, year, and designation</strong> based on their barcode, and even shows their profile photo retrieved from the database. A real-time dashboard displays live statistics such as total visitors for the day, current occupancy, and most visited departments.
      </p>
      <p>
        With built-in <strong>auto-exit functionality</strong>, the software ensures all active visits are closed at a specified time (e.g., 9 PM), even if the user forgets to scan out. It also includes a detailed analysis module where past logs can be filtered by department, designation, and date.
      </p>
      <p>
        Designed specifically for <strong>MIT College of Railway Engineering & Research (MITCORER)</strong>, this system makes library management accurate, efficient, and fully digital.
